## Cohort Study - Outline

```

## Cohort Studies
1. Go forward from exposure to outcome - prospective
    + How does this compare with case-control studies?
2. Usually two or more groups are followed up
    + Occupational groups/ professional categories
    + Geographically identified
    + Birth cohort, obstetric cohort
2. Possible to calculate incidence rate
3. Possible to calculate risk ratio/ relative risk

## Steps in Cohort Studies
- Define exposure, period of follow up and outcome
- Determine sample size
- Assemble the cohorts (selection based on exposure)
- Exposure assessment (records, interviews, tests etc.)
- Follow up
- Identify and count new cases
- Calculate incidence rate
- Calculate relative risk

## Relative Risk
Strength of association between the exposure and outcome is given by the relative risk

$$ Relative\ Risk = \frac{Incidence\ Rate_{Exposed}}{Incidence\ Rate_{Unexposed}} $$
  
- Relative Risk (RR) can range from Zero to Infinity
    + RR < 1; Protective factor
    + RR = 1; No association  
    + RR > 1; Risk factor
- Check the 95% Confidence Interval
    + What if the 95% CI include 1
    
## Risk Difference 1

$$ Attributable\ Risk_{Exposed} = IR_{Exposed} - IR_{Unexposed} $$  
    
    

$$ Attributable\ Fraction_{Exposed} = 
\frac{IR_{Exposed} - IR_{Unexposed}}
{IR_{Exposed}}$$

  
\n  




- IR - Incidence Rate
    
## Risk Difference 2



$$ Attributable\ Risk_{Population} = IR_{Population} - IR_{Unexposed} $$  
  
    
    

$$ Attributable\ Fraction_{Population} = 
\frac{IR_{Population} - IR_{Unexposed}}
{IR_{Population}}$$

- IR - Incidence Rate    
    
## Practical Considerations
- Recruitment – location, occupational group, birth cohort, etc. 	Representativeness?
- Sampling & sample size
- Adequate number of outcomes
- Reasonable duration of follow up
- Document exposure status (multiple factors possible)
- Ascertain outcome (can be more than one outcome)

## Baseline Assessment
- Age, sex, education, income, etc. – self report & documents
- Habits/ behavior
- Scales/ questionnaires
- Anthropometry – measurements
- Hematology, biochemistry, imaging etc.
- **Should be free of the outcome at the time of enrollment**

- Storage of biological material?
- Data entry and storage?

## Outcome Assessment
- Regular follow up – personal visits/ telephone
- Periodic follow up
    + Blinding?
- Record linkage – health service records or vital registration

  

## Modifications
- What is a retrospective cohort study? Isn't this a contradiction? 
    + The cohort is assembled retrospectively (i.e. Ragama first batch!)
    
- What is an ambidirectional cohort study?
    + Assemble a retrospective cohort and then follow up into the future.
    
## Cohort Studies - Advantages
- Can calculate the incidence rate & relative risk
- Identify natural history
- Exposure -> Outcome - temporal relationship
- Can study multiple outcomes


## Cohort Studies - Problems
- Usually take a long time to complete
- Change in exposure status
- Loss to follow up 
    + Differential
    + Non-differential
- Ethical issues
